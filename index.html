            <ul>
              <li><b>1881 : </b>Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards of the modern era, is born to Kendra and Percival Dumbledore in the village of Mould-on-the-Wold (DH2, DH11).</li>
              <li><b>1891 : </b>When Ariana Dumbledore was six years old, three muggle boys saw her doing underage magic. They demanded she show them what she was doing, and when she couldn’t, they attacked her. The event traumatized her, and led to the unraveling
                of the Dumbledore family. </li>
              <li><b>1891 : </b>After Ariana Dumbledore was attacked and traumatized by three muggle boys, her father Percival went after those boys to seek revenge. The attack was described as “savage” by Elphias Doge (DH2), and was well-publicized. Percival
                never explained the reason for his attack, in order to protect Ariana.</li>
              <li><b>1892 : </b>He is sorted into Gryffindor.</li>
              <li><b>1899 : </b>Ariana Dumbledore’s out-of-control magic accidentally killed Kendra Dumbledore during “one of [Ariana’s] rages,” when Ariana was only fourteen. (DH28) This happened right after Albus Dumbledore graduated from Hogwarts, and
                led to Albus becoming Ariana’s primary caretaker, in lieu of his plans to do a world tour with Elphias Doge.</li>
              <li><b>1899 : </b>He is examined in Transfiguration and Charms by Griselda Marchbanks, who later says that he did things with a wand she’d never seen before.</li>
              <li><b>1899 : </b>Angry that his brother is neglecting their fragile sister for his new friend, Aberforth confronts Albus and Grindelwald about their plans to leave Godric’s Hollow and make their mark on the world. Grindelwald tells Aberforth
                he just doesn’t understand, and then uses the Cruciatus Curse on the younger boy.</li>
              <li><b>1899 : </b>Ariana Dumbledore, sister of Albus and Aberforth, met her accidental death during a three-way duel between the brothers and Gellert Grindelwald (DH35). According to an interview given to Rita Skeeter by Bathilda Bagshot, the
                brothers had a “dreadful coffin-side brawl” during the funeral in which Aberforth bloodied Albus’s nose</li>
              <li><b>1930 : </b>Once and only once, Hogwarts staff and students put on a production of the story from Tales of Beedle the Bard. The play was directed by Professor Herbert Beery. The infamous performance resulted in a duel between actors and
                a huge fire caused by the ashwinder Kettleburn brought in for the production.</li>
              <li><b>1930 : </b>Armando Dippet is the Headmaster at this time. Albus Dumbledore is the Transfiguration teacher for several decades, starting in the 1930s. He eventually becomes the Headmaster in the mid-1960s. </li>
              <li><b>1938 : </b>After charming the skeptical matron with magic, manners, and gin, Dumbledore meets Riddle in his room and reveals that the boy is a wizard and invites him to Hogwarts. Tom Riddle proves himself to be a bossy, hostile, independent,
                and calculating child who terrifies and torments the other orphans.</li>
              <li><b>1943 : </b>Believing Hagrid innocent, Dumbledore convinces Headmaster Dippet to let the boy stay.</li>
              <li><b>1945 : </b>The threat posed by Grindelwald and his plans for world domination became so dire that the Wizarding world clamored for Dumbledore to intervene. It was only when he had no choice that Dumbledore finally confronted his old friend
                in an epic duel.</li>
              <li><b>1966 : </b>Dumbledore becomes Headmaster after serving as Transfiguration teacher for several decades. He replaces Armando Dippet.</li>
              <li><b>1966 : </b>Ten years after the death of Hepzibah Smith, Voldemort returns to Hogwarts, ostensibly to ask Dumbledore for a teaching job. Dumbledore refuses. He then curses the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, and since that day,
                no professor has stayed for more than one year in that post. </li>
              <li><b>1980 : </b>When Dumbledore met at the Hog’s Head with Sybill Trelawney as a “courtesy” to interview her for the post of Divination Professor, she suddenly launched into a real prophecy about a child with the ability to vanquish the Dark
                Lord. </li>
              <li><b>1980 : </b>Dumbledore meets her at the Hog’s Head about taking the position, although he is disinclined to continue offering Divination at all. Trelawney then makes a prophecy about a baby who will be born at the end of July, a baby who
                will be able to defeat the Dark Lord</li>
              <li><b>1980 : </b>Death Eater Severus Snape sent a message to Albus Dumbledore to meet him on a lonely windswept hilltop in late 1980 so he could warn him that Lily Evans Potter and her child were in danger of being attacked by Voldemort (DH33).</li>
              <li><b>1981 : </b>Severus Snape is hired by Dumbledore to teach Potions at Hogwarts.</li>
              <li><b>1981 : </b>Hagrid arrives with Harry on Sirius’s flying motorbike. Dumbledore is waiting in Privet Drive to leave the baby with the Dursleys. </li>
              <li><b>1991 : </b>Among his Christmas gifts, Harry is astonished to receive is an Invisibility Cloak with an anonymous notes informing Harry that it had belonged to his father, and the admonition to “Use it well” (PS12). </li>

                in that disused classroom.</li>
              <li><b>1992 : </b>When Professor McGonagall finds Harry in the hallway near the petrified Justin Finch-Fletchly and Nearly Headless Nick (CS11), she takes him to Dumbledore’s Office, using the password “Sherbet Lemon” (CS12). While waiting,

              <li><b>1996 : </b>On the evening of June 18, 1996, a running battle is fought between members of the D.A. led by Harry Potter, a group of Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy, and members of the Order of the Phoenix. Sirius Black is killed and

              <li><b>1996 : </b>He comes to collect Harry but needs to settle a few details first. Thinking Dumbledore coming to take him on an errand and then to the Burrow might just be too good to be true, Harry hasn’t packed or told the Dursleys about

              <li><b>1996 : </b>July 13, 1996, just after midnight – En route to the Burrow from Privet Drive, Dumbledore takes Harry to call on Horace Slughorn – who, in trying to evade the Death Eaters, possible employers, and anyone who would make him
